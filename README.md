# DahlquistLab
This is the website for the Kam Dahlquist Lab in the Department of Biology at Loyola Marymount University.

This site is currently under construction as content migrates from the old site (http://myweb.lmu.edu/kdahlqui/index.htm).

Migration is expected to be completed by mid-January 2018.

Please see our related projects GRNmap (http://kdahlquist.github.io/GRNmap/) and GRNsight (http://dondi.github.io/GRNsight/).
