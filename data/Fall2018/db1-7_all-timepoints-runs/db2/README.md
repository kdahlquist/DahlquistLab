Input and output files for db2.
* It turns out that the dHAP4 expression data is missing data for all three replicates of t90 for STB5. Create new input file with the dHAP4 data deleted and run that instead, called _14-gene_25-edges_db2_Sigmoid_estimation_all-timepoints_no-dHAP4-data.xlsx_.
* The initial version of the input file, I forgot to specify the new expression and simulated timepoints in the optimization_parameters worksheet.
