Input and output files for db5.
* _15-genes_28-edges_db5_Sigmoid_estimation_all-timepoints_no-dHAP4-data.xlsx_ has no dHAP4 expression data because all three replicates are missing for STB5 for t90 for dHAP4 data.
Note in the initial version of the file, I forgot to update the optimization_parameters sheet with the correct timepoints for the expression and simulated data.
