Input and output files for db6.
* Note in the initial version of the file, I forgot to update the optimization_parameters sheet with the correct timepoints for the expression and simulated data.
* Cannot run corrected input file due to bug, see GRNmap issue: https://github.com/kdahlquist/GRNmap/issues/411
* Turns out that some of the data in the expression worksheet was formatted as text.  Once this has been fixed, the model runs.  Restart run on _bayanus_ using code from @jtorre39's fork, beta branch at 10/29/18 at 1:07 PM and ending at 2:52 PM.
