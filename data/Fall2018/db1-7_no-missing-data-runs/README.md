This directory contains copies of db1-7 input workbooks where missing replicates of expression data was filled in with average values.  These need to be rerun with the same version of the GRNmap software as the "missing-data" runs for a fair comparison.
* Ran on _paradoxus_ single processors on 10/29/18 using GRNmap v1.10 pre-release beta.

Run a replicate of the db5 no-missing-values input workbook on 10/30/18 for direct comparison with the db5 no-missing-values runs, which is being run at the same time on _bayanus_ starting at 2:32 and 2:33 PM, respectively.  Need to know if the results are the same or similar when missing values are there.
