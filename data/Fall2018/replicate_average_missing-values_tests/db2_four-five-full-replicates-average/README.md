This file is db2, but with wt-only expression data.  There are 4 replicates for t15, 5 replicates for t30, four replicates for t60.  However, all replicates are simply the average value for that timepoint's expression from the original file.  I.e., for t15, there the same logFC is given for each of the four replicates, no values are missing.
