I started comparing the data for missing values and no missing values. There were significant differences between the outputs. The values signifying magnitude had changed, and some values changed from activators to repressors and vice versa. The results were input into GRNmap so we could see how different the outputs were.

I ran GRNmap on the db5 data with missing and no missing values. There was trouble running the program on Windows 11, so I am using the lab computer that runs Windows 7. Both runs finished successfully but took about 3-4.5 hours to complete.
