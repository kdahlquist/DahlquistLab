Original runs of this trial had an incorrect weight, so these files were rerun by KD on her personal laptop. For consistency with all the other trials, they were later run on the lab computer so all data would be from the same Matlab version. The data in the folder 'rerun on lab computer' should be used for any future analysis. For PB and no constants there is not a seperate folder that was created to house the new data, instead use files with "rerun" in the file names. The .png images uploaded are consistent with the rerun trials.
