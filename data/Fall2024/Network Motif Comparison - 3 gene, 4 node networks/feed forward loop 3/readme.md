9/16/25: This network had an extra weight in the network_weights sheet, but did not have an extra weight in the network sheet. The error was fixed and the forward simulation re-run.  The results were identical with or without the extra weight in the network_weights sheet.  I corrected the data (9/16/25) and now the sheets are without errors. The results from the second, corrected version is what is now found in this folder.
