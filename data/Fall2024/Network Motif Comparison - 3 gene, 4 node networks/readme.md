3 gene, 4 node networks based on all possible connected network motifs
- files were renamed once all possible networks had been run: 
- NC trial 1 is "regulating mutual"
- NC trial 2 is "mutual out 2"
- NC trial 3 is "FBL" feedback loop
- NC trial 4 is "mutual in 2"
- NC trial 5 is "mutual in 1" 
- NC trial 6 is "FFL3" feed-forward loop (isomorph with trial 16). On 9/9/25, NC looked at the forward simulation input file and found that there is an extra edge, gene1 was also autoregulating to make 5 edges.  Likely can delete this trial because it was an isomorph with trial 16, and replace it with the network that is missing.
- NC trial 7 is "mutual out 1"
- NC trial 8 is "mutual cascade"
- NC trial 9 is "regulated mutual"
- NC trial 10 is "bimutual"

- 2.2	-> trial 13 
- 2.3	-> trial 14
- 2.4	-> trial 15
