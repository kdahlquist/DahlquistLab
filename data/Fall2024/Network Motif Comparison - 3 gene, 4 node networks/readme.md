3 gene, 4 node networks based on all possible connected network motifs
- files were renamed once all possible networks had been run: 
- regulating mutual -> trial 1
- mutual out 2	-> trial 2
- FBL	-> trial 3
- mutual in 2 -> trial 4
- mutual in 1	-> trial 5 (isomorph with trial 13)
- FFL3 ->	trial 6
- mutual out 1	-> trial 7
- mutual cascade	-> trial 8
- regulated mutual ->	trial 9
- bimutual ->	trial 10
- FFL1 ->	trial 11
- 2.1	-> trial 12
- 2.2	-> trial 13 (isomorph wiht trial 5)
- 2.3	-> trial 14
- 2.4	-> trial 15
- 2.5	-> trial 16
- 2.6	-> trial 17
- 2.7	-> trial 18
