This directory contains derived data files that compile or analyze the raw data from db1-db6.

* "Bar-Chart-Analysis_BK20161116.xlsx": Compiled data from db1-db6, all of outputs from GRNmap, production rates, threshold b, and MSE's with accompanying bar charts.
* "Graph-Statistics-Comparison_BK20170315.pptx": Bar charts of Out-degree, in-degree, Eigen centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality for db1-db6.
* "Output-Graph-Analysis_BK20161116.xlsx": For db1-db6, compilation of the within-strain ANOVA p values for the genes present in each network.
* "Regulatory-Relationships_Six-Networks_BK20170313.xlsx": "Plug-and-play" workbook for comparing edge weights across db1-db6 and calculate the basic statistics, mean, median, standard deviation. Normalization of edge weights to the maximum weight value provided and generation of an accompanying heat map is also automated.
* "db1-through-db6_compiled-ANOVA-values_BK20170405.xlsx": Compiled data of within-strain ANOVA B-H p values for db1-db6 on one worksheet.
* "db1-through-db6_compiled-optimized_parameters_BK20170405.xlsx": Compiled data of optimized production rates and threshold b values for db1-db6, each parameter has its own sheet.
* "random-networks_weight-distribution-graphs_BK20170405.xlsx": For the three best and three worst random networks, scaled, normalized weight values to input into SPSS. Instructions for generating the associated weight value histograms and cumulative plots are provided here: Generating_Distribution_Charts_and_Cumulative_Plots_for_GRNmap_Weight_Values_in_SPSS.
