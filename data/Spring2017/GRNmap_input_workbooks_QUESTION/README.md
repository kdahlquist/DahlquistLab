It seems that these files might be the ones that we discarded in favor of the folder that has the boulardii2 output.  Please confirm.

However, there are some Gephi output files here as well.

All Gephi files need to be moved to their respective folders.

We need to confirm that the Gephi output is from the correct GRNmap model output.
