## Test Conditions

* Date: January 16, 2018 
* Run-time: Started at 4:44pm | Ended at 8:08pm
* Test Performed by: @maggie-oneil
* Code Version: beta
* MATLAB Version: R2014b
* Computer on which the model was run: paradoxus

## Purpose

To use as a control to determine how workbooks with missing data run on the beta version of GRNmap as compared to workbooks with missing data on v1.8 or workbooks with no missing data on v1.8 

## Results

* Input sheet: 15-genes_28-edges_db5-MO-LK_Sigmoid_estimation_missing-values.xlsx
* Output sheet: 15-genes_28-edges_db5-MO-LK_Sigmoid_estimation_missing-values_output.xlsx
** LSE: 0.700272594
** Penalty term: 2.50652055
** Number of iterations (counter):111242
* Figures (all expression graphs .jpg files zipped together): See Images folder 
* Save the progress figure containing the counts manually: See Images folder

## Discussion
It was determined we can run the v1.8 beta model using the missing data file as a baseline, and this is the type of run which will be performed for the entirety of the edge deletion experiments
