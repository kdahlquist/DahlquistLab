GRNmap Testing Report
## Test Conditions

* Date: January 16, 2018
* Run time: Started at 4:25pm | Ended at 7:28pm
* Test Performed by: @maggie-oneil
* Code Version: v1.8
* MATLAB Version: R2014b
* Computer on which the model was run: cerevisiae

## Purpose

*To serve as a control for the edge deletion experiment. Looking at how workbooks with missing data run on GRNmap v1.8 as compared to running workbooks with missing data on the beta version of GRNmap or workbooks with no missing data on v1.8 of GRNmap

## Results

* Input sheet: 15-genes_28-edges_db5-MO-LK_Sigmoid_estimation_missing-values.xlsx
* Output sheet: 15-genes_28-edges_db5-MO-LK_Sigmoid_estimation_missing-values_output.xlsx
** LSE: 0.700272594
** Penalty term: 2.50652055 
** Number of iterations (counter): 111242
* Figures (all expression graphs .jpg files zipped together): See images folder
* Save the progress figure containing the counts manually: See images folder

## Discussion

Determined that v1.8 beta with misisng data would be the best model to run for the edge deletion experiment
