### GRNmap Testing Report
## Test Conditions

* Date: January 22, 2018
* Run time: Started at 3:29pm
* Test Performed by: @maggie-oneil
* Code Version: beta
* MATLAB Version: R2014b
* Computer on which the model was run: paradoxus CPU1

## Purpose
To run the intact network under the same conditions as the edge deletion networks to use as a control for comparison of how the netowrk runs normally on the model as compared to each edge deletion network. 

## Results

* Input sheet: Intact_15-genes_28-edges_db5-MO-LK_Sigmoid_estimation.xlsx
* Output sheet: Intact_15-genes_28-edges_db5-MO-LK_Sigmoid_estimation_output.xlsx
* LSE: 0.700272594
* Penalty term: 2.50652055
* Number of iterations (counter): 111242
* Figures (all expression graphs .jpg files zipped together): See Images folder
* Save the progress figure containing the counts manually: See Images folder

## Discussion
This model run will be used as a baseline for model performance for all analyses done in the Analysis of Edge Deletion Runs folder
