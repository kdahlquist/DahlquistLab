This folder contains subfolders which contain information on each GRNmap model run for each edge deletion. Nomenclature is based on the directionality of the edge. For example, the folder titled "dACE2-ASH1 Run" is the model run in which the edge from ACE2 to ASH1 has been deleted. 

Within each subfolder there is also meta-data corresponding to information on each model run in accordance to the template found in the DahlquistLAb/data/Spring 2018 README.md file. All edge deletion model runs were run using the "missing data" db5 workbook derived input books, and these input workbooks were all run on the GRNmap beta available as of January 20th, 2018. The code for this version of GRNmap is found in a zipped folder within this folder of the data repository. The .zip file is named "GRNmap_beta_1-20-18.zip." This version of the code can also be found on a flashdrive in the Dahlquist Lab (LSB 2__). It is located in the top drawer of the computer space under the "boulardii 2" computer

Another note on the model runs, there are 3 input workbooks in which a node has been entirely deleted, because when we deleted the affiliated edge, the node became free-floating in the network. These network variants are:
*dGCR2-MSN2 (GCR2 deleted entirely)
*dYHP1-GLN3 (GLN3 deleted entirely)
*dZAP1-ACE2 (ZAP1 deleted entirely)
