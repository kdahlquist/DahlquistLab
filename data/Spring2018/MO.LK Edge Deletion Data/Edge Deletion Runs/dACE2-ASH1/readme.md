* Penalty term: 2.686274945
* Number of iterations (counter): 108780
* Figures (all expression graphs .jpg files zipped together): See Images folder
* Save the progress figure containing the counts manually: See Images folder

## Discussion 
This model run will be used as a baseline for model performance for all analyses done in the Analysis of Edge Deletion Runs folder
