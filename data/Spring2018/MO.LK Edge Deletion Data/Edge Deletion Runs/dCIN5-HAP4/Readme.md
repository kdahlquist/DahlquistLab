### GRNmap Testing Report
## Test Conditions

* Date: January 22, 2018
* Run time: Started at 3:38pm
* Test Performed by: @maggie-oneil
* Code Version: beta
* MATLAB Version: R2014b
* Computer on which the model was run: paradoxus CPU4

## Purpose
To determine the importance of the CIN5-->HAP4 edge by deleting the edge as a part of the larger db5 edge deletion experiment

## Results

* Input sheet: dCIN5-HAP4_15-genes_27-edges_db5-MO-LK_Sigmoid_estimation.xlsx
* Output sheet:  dCIN5-HAP4_15-genes_27-edges_db5-MO-LK_Sigmoid_estimation_output.xlsx
* LSE: 0.701864023
* Penalty term: 2.16029378
* Number of iterations (counter): 70980
* Figures (all expression graphs .jpg files zipped together): See Images folder
* Save the progress figure containing the counts manually: See Images folder

## Discussion

This model run will be used as for the CIN5-->HAP4 data for model performance comparison for all analyses done in the Analysis of Edge Deletion Runs folder
