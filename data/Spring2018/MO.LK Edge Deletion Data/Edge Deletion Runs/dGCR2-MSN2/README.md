* Run time: Started at 3:26pm
* Test Performed by: @maggie-oneil
* Code Version: beta
* MATLAB Version: R2014b
* Computer on which the model was run: cerevisiae (all CPU)

## Purpose
To determine the importance of the GCR2 --> MSN2 edge by deleting the edge as a part of the larger db5 edge deletion experiment

## Results

* Input sheet: dGCR2-MSN2_14-genes_27-edges_db5-MO-LK_Sigmoid_estimation.xlsx
* Output sheet: dGCR2-MSN2_14-genes_27-edges_db5-MO-LK_Sigmoid_estimation_output.xlsx

* Penalty term: 2.783655026
* Number of iterations (counter): 97935
* Figures (all expression graphs .jpg files zipped together): See Images folder
* Save the progress figure containing the counts manually: See Images folder

## Discussion
This model run will be used for the GCR2â€”>MSN2 data for model performance comparison for all analyses done in the Analysis of Edge Deletion Runs folder
