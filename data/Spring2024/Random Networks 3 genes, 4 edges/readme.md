An extensive amount of test networks were created from the Rscripts in order to find all possible 3 gene, 4 edge networks. These networks were then narrowed down to just a few and later just 1 for further sensitivity testing in order to determine why the outputs for the missing and no missing data files had variences 

This folder contains only the basic structure of the networks, not the input files to run in GRNmap
