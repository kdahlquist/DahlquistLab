The i1 and i2 files did not behave terribly, so using those as a basis I changed up some of the weights to 2 to see how the results would turn out. I had done the coherent one's first and changed up the weights doign all combinations of 2s and 1s and some of them ran and did well and some did poorly, and some did not finish. Just to see if there would be correlation between which weights did well and which did not, I went ahead and just ran the combinations that did well in the i1 and i2 motifs. Since I's trying to get a sense of the best behavior, I ran the sheets for now with just PB constant so the weights were the only things being estimated.
